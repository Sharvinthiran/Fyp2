# Ransomware Detection Using Behavioral Analysis

This is the official repository for my Final Year Project (FYP 2) titled **"Ransomware Detection Using Behavioral Analysis"**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a desktop application that detects potential ransomware activity based on behavioral patterns. Unlike traditional signature-based antivirus tools, this system monitors file characteristics, suspicious extensions, and entropy levels to identify threats in real-time.

## 💻 Features
- Real-time folder and file scanning
- Detection of suspicious file behavior (e.g., unknown extensions, high entropy)
- Options to **quarantine**, **delete**, or **ignore** suspicious files
- Simple GUI built using Python Tkinter

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- Custom-built **behavioral analysis** module
